In 2023, we continued to improve our \n","employee benefits such as expanding our paid parental leave policy. We also continued to invest in developing \n","our people. We engaged Rice & Associates to initiate our second High Performance Leadership program to help \n","ensure we have a strong pipeline of future leaders. Additionally, we continued to make progress in our diversity, \n","equity, and inclusion programs to spread a wider net for diverse talent. \n","\n","Protecting Our Planet\n","Armada Hoffler remained more committed than ever to minimizing our impact on the environment. We took additional \n","steps to further gather and analyze our emissions data. In 2023, we acquired the mixed-use project, The Interlock, \n","in the West Midtown area of Atlanta, Georgia. The Interlock features open airways and is a community centered \n","destination. Additionally, we continue to remain committed to fostering a green community at Harbor Point, which will be \n","Baltimore’s first true “eco-district;” a concept that expands on the idea of making individual buildings environmentally \n","friendly (based on the U.S. Building Council’s LEED Program) by engineering these qualities into the entire neighborhood.   \n","\n","Supporting Our Communities \n","From our earliest days, Armada Hoffler has been dedicated to supporting local neighborhoods, cities, and towns. Today, \n","we remain committed to working with local nonprofits, academic institutions, and civic leaders to make our communities \n","a better place to work, live, and play. In 2023, this included creating new jobs and supporting local suppliers through \n","projects such as our Southern Post development in Roswell, Georgia. We also continued to support partners such as \n","Operation Homefront and other organizations that provide a helping hand to families during trying times.\n","\n","Underlying all we do is our commitment to conducting our business ethically and with integrity. I believe this starts \n","with strong governance practices and leadership from our Board of Directors, whom I want to thank for their ongoing \n","support and guidance during a year that continued to present challenges for business, society, and the environment. \n","\n","As stakeholder interest in sustainability continues to grow, we continue to enhance our sustainability reporting by \n","taking into consideration guidance from the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Real Estate sector \n","standards and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Going forward, we remain committed to \n","transparency and disclosure.\n","\n","Finally, I would like to thank our Armada Hoffler employees for their ongoing resilience and dedication to the work that \n","we do and the communities we serve. They are the core of our business and continue to be a source of inspiration. \n","\n","As I look forward to 2024, I am optimistic that Armada Hoffler is well positioned to create ongoing value through our \n","relentless focus on sustainability in all aspects of our business and ongoing engagement with stakeholders.\n","\n","Louis Haddad\n","Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","052 0 2 3  S U S T A I N A B I L I T Y  R E P O R T\n","\n","\n","\n","Provide each employee with a \n","safe, welcoming, and inclusive \n","work environment and culture that \n","enables them to contribute fully and \n","develop to their highest potential.\n","\n","ASPIRATIONS\n","\n","PEOPLE\n","\n","T A L E N T  M A N A G E M E N T\n","\n","D I V E R S I T Y,  E Q U I T Y,  &  I N C L U S I O N \n","\n","H U M A N  R I G H T S\n","\n","H E A LT H  &  S A F E T Y \n","\n","KEY PRIORITIES\n","\n","Armada Hoffler has always placed value on being a sustainability \n","leader, driving higher standards both inside and outside of the real \n","estate industry.
